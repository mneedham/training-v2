== About this module

Now that we've got a basic understanding of the data we're going to build a recommendation engine for authors.

At the end of this module, you should be able to:
[square]
* Query a database for its schema
* Return and chart the number of node labels and relationship types using matplotlib
* Build and plot a histogram of papers and their citations using pandas and matplotlib


== Collaborative Filtering

Collaborative filtering is based on the idea that people like things similar to other things they like, and things that are liked by other people with similar taste.

In our dataset there are a couple of different recommendations that we can generate.

Authors may be interested in reading other papers written by their coauthors.
We can also recommend future collaborators by finding the people that their coauthors have collaborated with.

== Exercise 1: Building a recommendation engine

We're going to build a mini recommendation engine using a Jupyter Notebook hosted on the Google Colaboratory environment.
We can launch the notebook by clicking on the button below.

[TIP]
====
Once you've completed the notebook come back to this page to check your understanding of the material in this module.
