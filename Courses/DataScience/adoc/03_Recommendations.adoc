== About this module

Now that we've got a basic understanding of the data we're going to build a recommendation engine for authors.

At the end of this module, you should be able to write Cypher queries to:
[square]
* find potential collaborators for an author
* find relevant papers about a topic for an author


== Collaborative Filtering

Collaborative filtering is based on the idea that people like things similar to other things they like, and things that are liked by other people with similar taste.

In our dataset there are a couple of different recommendations that we can generate.

Authors may be interested in reading other papers written by their coauthors.
We can also recommend future collaborators by finding the people that their coauthors have collaborated with.

== Exercise 1: Coauthor Collaborative Filtering with Cypher

We're going to write recommendation queries to *suggest potential collaborators* using a Jupyter Notebook hosted on the Google Colaboratory environment.
We can launch the notebook by clicking on the button below.

== PageRank and Personalized PageRank

PageRank is an algorithm that measures the *transitive* influence or connectivity of nodes.
It can be computed by either iteratively distributing one node's rank (originally based on degree) over its neighbours or by randomly traversing the graph and counting the frequency of hitting each node during these walks.

Personalized PageRank (PPR) is a variant of this algorithm that is biased towards a set of source nodes.
It is often used as part of building recommender systems.

== Exercise 2: Article recommendations with Personalized PageRank

We're going to do an exercise to practice using the PageRank algorithm, understand the difference between PageRank and PPR, and use PPR to *suggest relevant articles* to an author.
