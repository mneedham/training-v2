== About this module

Now that we've got a basic understanding of the data
In this module we'll learn how to explore the data in the citation dataset that we'll be using in this course.
We'll be querying Neo4j and processing the results using tools in the Python ecosystem.

At the end of this module, you should be able to:
[square]
* Query a database for its schema
* Return and chart the number of node labels and relationship types using matplotlib
* Build and plot a histogram of papers and their citations using pandas and matplotlib


=== Collaborative Filtering

Collaborative filtering is based on the idea that people like things similar to other things they like, and things that are liked by other people with similar taste.
