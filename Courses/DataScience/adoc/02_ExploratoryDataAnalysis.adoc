== About this module

In the previous section, we setup our Neo4j Sandbox environment containing the citation dataset.
In this module we're going to explore that data.
We'll be querying Neo4j and processing the results using tools in the Python ecosystem.

At the end of this module, you should be able to:
[square]
* Query a database for its schema
* Return and chart the number of node labels and relationship types using matplotlib
* Build and plot a histogram of papers and their citations using pandas and matplotlib


== Tools

We'll be using the following Python libraries in this course:

=== py2neo

The https://py2neo.org/v4/[py2neo^] driver enables data scientists to easily integrate Neo4j with tools in the Python Data Science ecosystem.
It does this by providing functions that translate the results of queries into data structures used by these tools.
We'll be using this library to execute Cypher queries against Neo4j.

=== pandas

https://pandas.pydata.org/[pandas^] is an open source, BSD-licensed library providing high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools for the Python programming language.
We'll be using this library to do post processing of the data that we query from Neo4j.

=== Matplotlib

https://matplotlib.org/[Matplotlib^] is a Python 2D plotting library which produces publication quality figures in a variety of hardcopy formats and interactive environments across platforms.
We'll be using this library to create charts based on our data.


== Citation Dataset

Now we're ready to start exploring the data.
The graph model for the dataset is shown below:

image::{imagedir}/graph.png[Graph Model,width=600]

We want to get a feeling for what data we're working with, including the distribution of authors, papers, and citations.
We'll then be able to use this knowledge to help us when we're building a recommendation engine and making predictions on the data.

== Exercise 1: Exploring the data

We're going to explore the data via a Jupyter Notebook hosted on the Google Colaboratory environment.
We can launch the notebook by clicking on the button below.
